## 📈 Training Progress

### Cisco Python Essentials 1

📂 **Exercises**

This repository documents my progression in Python through a series of practical exercises located in the exercises/ directory. These exercises helped me consolidate core concepts such as functions, control flow, data validation, and exception handling.

🧠 **Skills Practiced**

By working on unit conversions, BMI calculation, factorials, Fibonacci sequences, and LED-style number rendering, I practiced applying mathematical logic, loops, recursion, and core data structures such as lists and dictionaries.

📝 **Code Quality & Documentation**

The consistent use of docstrings and doctests reflects a focus on writing clear, readable, and well-documented code, following good Python development practices.

🎓 **Certifications**

Additional documentation related to my completed certification is available in a separate repository:
